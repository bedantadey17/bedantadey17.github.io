        <p><i><b>Posted on: 01-07-2024</b></i></p><br>

        <p>Hey guys! For my first blogpost, I have a BANGER for you all. I will tell you exactly, how to do the unthinkable, the daring... <b>HOW TO UNINSTALL MICROSOFT EDGE</b>.<br><br>
        Now, before you say that you have tried it and failed miserably, let me tell you, you're not at fault. Windows makes it exceptionally difficult for any sane individual to uninstall their browser, and although Edge has some pretty dang good features, most of us prefer to use other, "safer" alternatives, like Firefox, or Brave (for all you people who can't waste three clicks to install an adblocker).<br><br>
        Anyways, here are the steps you need to take to uninstall Edge, the Microsoft browser that not many people (like to) use.<br><br>

        <h2><span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">[!]</span> You must install a separate browser before doing this procedure.</h2><br>

        <h3>Method is very strong. However, future updates may affect procedure.</h3><br>

        <ul>
            
            <li>First, we have to remove the shortcut from the Start Menu. This is done so that, after uninstallation, a dead start menu item does not remain.
            Right-click the Edge icon in the start menu, navigate to 'Open file location', delete the shortcut. The 'Microsoft Edge' title from your start menu should be gone.</li><br>
        
            <li>Navigate to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft</code> and delete every folder that starts with 'Edge'. If some files can't be deleted, try your best till very few (or ideally, none) files remain.</li><br>

            <li>Download <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bedantadey17/filesystem/main/useful/UninstallTool.zip" target="_blank"><b><u>UninstallTool</u></b></a> from this link or download it from <a href="https://itscosmo.live/files/"><b><u>my file repository</u></b></a> (useful > UninstallTool.zip). Use it to uninstall every 'Edge'-related item. Also, commit force removal.</li></ul><br>

        This should have removed every single 'Edge'-related instance on your computer. This method has been tested on Windows 10 and 11, LTSC and non-LTSC installations, and they have succeeded without fail.
