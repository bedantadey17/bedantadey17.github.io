    <h1>What happened to Spotibridge?</h1><br>

    <p>Well, the API that I was using kept going down everytime I was about to use the site.<br>
    There was no reason it should, it was sourced by ChatGPT itself, so I thought it was<br>
    choosing a good enough API. I am too tired to find a good enough API, so I am putting SB<br>
    on hiatus for now. But, while you are here, you can check my other works on my <a href="https://github.com/bedantadey17" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
