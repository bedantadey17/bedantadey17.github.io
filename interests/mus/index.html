        <h1><b><a href="/interests/">#</a> Music</b></h1><br>
        <p>My music choices are considered 'volatile' at best. It changes almost every year or so. However, my most favorite genre is <b>Rock</b>. My most favorite band is also, God's favorite band, <b><u><a href="https://greenday.com" target="_blank">Green Day</a></u></b>. Other than Rock, I am currently into a very obscure genre, known as "Shoegaze" or more commonly "Dream pop". It can also be linked to Alt rock, however, shoegaze feels like a genre in and of itself.</p>
        <p>The music service I use is <b><span style="color: #1DB954">Spotify</span></b>. I have a premium plan which I got for very cheap and I have all my playlists set up there. It's very cool. There are currently 4 playlists I mainly listen to: </p>

        <p>- <u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/51GHJs009QMHvGvoMG9ri9?si=f6d0be346a1a4e8d" target="_blank">seasons under sky</a></u> - a playlist that contains my all-time favorites, no genre specific<br>
           - <u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5rQzuY1eiP6xy5talO0n1N?si=3355fd322d8d467e" target="_blank">pure, uncut rock</a></u> - contains my all-time favorite jams, rock genre only<br>
           - <u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/79zlOiXdJBux16V2jSdu35?si=2f91c585aee341c7" target="_blank">shoegazing at stars</a></u> - the recent playlist i made for all my shoegaze music<br>
           - <u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5kVnuFGDGe1T6p6t2FGfGh?si=86c6b3a976584d5b" target="_blank">hindi gems</a></u> - this playlist is all for my hindi songs, i play this mainly during travel<br></p>

        <p>If you look at those playlists, you will have an idea of what music I like. I am not writing every song I liked individually, as that would be absurd. Oh, and <u><b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31soq477zls3wtppxdxcdr36n4my" target="_blank">here is my Spotify profile</a></u></b>.</p>
