        <h1><b><a href="/interests/">#</a> Programming</b></h1><br>
        <p>I had started programming and coding since the age of 13. Since my childhood, I was amazed by how computers run and work. So, I picked up the most "easy" and available language at that time, <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank"><span style="color: #89b4fa">Py</span><span style="color: #f9e2af">thon</span></a>. Python was a pretty simple language for me to get started in, and I recommend almost every new programmer to learn Python and write programs in it. It is not only simple, it's very widely used, so it will help you in the future if you want to go for IT jobs.</p>
        <p>I had watched YouTubers like <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww">CodeWithHarry</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Telusko">Telusko</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingHero">ProgrammingHero</a></u>. They helped me A LOT in getting started, and I still recommend them to anyone who asks me questions like "Where do I start learning?" and things like that.</p>
        <p>Lately, I haven't been able to code a lot, and I am just spending some time coding this website. If you want to check what I made in the recent months/year, check out my <u><a href="https://github.com/bedantadey17"><span style="color: #c9c9c9; font-weight: bold;">GitHub</span></a></u>. My old GitHub account(s) are lost media.</p><br>
        <p>If anyone wants to start making programs and software development, I would like you to ask yourself what your interest is — standalone software or web development? Judging from the choice that it's standalone software development, I can give you some advice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer <b>standalone software</b> development, I would recommend you to start from <b>PYTHON 3</b>. It's what I started with, it's what most people start with. Mainly because of its simple syntax, yet powerful scope. If you want to get started with python, you can read books, documentation or watch the YouTubers I mentioned before.</p>

        <p>If you like <b>web</b> development, sadly I do not have any concrete resources for you, mainly because I had learnt basic web-dev using HTML from school, and CSS solely from experience by tinkering with various websites and their source codes. I basically went into it raw, if you catch my drift.</p>
